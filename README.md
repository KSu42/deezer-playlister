Creates a list of Deezer playlist URLs then prints each of them to console on a new line without quotes. Can easily copy/paste the result into a text file.

* A browser with developer tools console.
  * Chrome works.
  * Firefox works.
  * Edge works.
  * Safari works, but I don't know an easy way to copy the result from console.
  * IE does NOT work.

> ## How To Use
>
> 1. Navigate to your Deezer account's playlist page (example: https://www.deezer.com/us/profile/2289853948/playlists).
> 2. Right-click on page.
> 3. Select `Inspect` or `Inspect Element`.
> 4. Select the `Console` tab.
> 5. Scroll all the way to the bottom of the Deezer playlist page so all the playlist elements load.
> 6. Copy/paste the code into console and run!
>
